### Project Overview

 The project is based on the usage of **Pandas **as a python library in the field of Data Science.
It is related to loan approval done by the banks with regard to the users details.
It involves complicated ways which are done for the approval analysis.


### Learnings from the project

 Application of Pandas and how it can be used differently in the real world.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The csv file already containing the original table(data) was present and it was converted to Pandas Dataframe to study for further stastical analysis.


### Challenges faced

 Pandas and Numpy are a broad category and includes a lot of functions and operations. I had difficulty in applying some of them as I have just begun learning them.
