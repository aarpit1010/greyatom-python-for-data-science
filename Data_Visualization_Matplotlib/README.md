### Project Overview

 Getting visual insights of **Dream Housing Finance company** and it's operations. 
Using the** data visualization** techniques, I had to visualise the data and arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I now have a better understanding of **data visualization** techniques along with **data wrangling** with python and its libraries.
The concepts applied in this project :

    - Bar plotting

    - Scatter plotting

    - Kernel Density plotting

    - Subplot operations

    - Axes modifications

    - Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Solving the problem was not difficult. 
Basically, read the csv file first by "read_csv" and import all the necessary libraries needed to perform the task.
Next step was to find out the required data from the csv file via pandas and apply them in the syntaxes of the graphs and perform customisations.


### Additional pointers

 The human brain can process visual data way more times than simple text.
So, data visualization is a very important aspect in Machine Learning and Data Science. Hence, studying the correlation between different libraries of python and how to practically apply them in a visual manner is very important.
