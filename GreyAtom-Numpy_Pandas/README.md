### Project Overview

 A basic and a simple project related to "**Census**" based on the applications of python libraries, **Numpy** and **Pandas**.


### Learnings from the project

 Proficient use python libraries and its applications in **Data Science**


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach was to analyze the data given in the form of a table and what all was to be found according to the project motive.
After that, I just started with a numpy array and worked with the specific rows and columns over which changes were to be made.



### Challenges faced

 A few of the syntaxes were difficult to remember so there was a need to have a recap over functions while solving the project.
But, the usage was pretty forward so there was not much difficulty in applying them.


### Additional pointers

 I am in the early stages only of learning Data Science using python and these small projects are really helpful in understanding the concepts.
